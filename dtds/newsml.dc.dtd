     This is the definition of the dc element of 
     Reuters Experimental NewsML DTD.

     NewsML implements some Dublin Core elements implicitly in
     other parts of the encoding, and hence does not repeat
     those values in this part.    
 
     The Dublin Core semantics supported are supported in a 
     specialized way, and this is based on a scheme for 
     "Reuters Web" developed by Misha Wolf and Charles Wicksteed.
     It is not the same as that scheme.
 
     There are undoubtedly better ways of encoding the 
     Dublin Core - especially RDF. See XN-5 for why RDF was
     not used in this revision.
